The core setup is complete. Following the standard project flow for student-welfare-platform, the next logical steps are:

Global Configuration: Setting up a ConfigModule to manage environment variables (Port, JWT secrets, etc.) type-safely.

Global Filters & Pipes: Setting up validation (ValidationPipe) and exception handling (HttpExceptionFilter).

Authentication: Starting the Auth module (JWT, Login, Registration).
